					<p style="font-family:NokiaFC;font-size:65%;text-align:left;margin-top:-92px;margin-left:110px;width:408px;">Wow, this brings back a lot of memories.<br>
					It seems fitting that I make this the first fanart added to this<br>
					new website since this was also the first fanart added to the<br>
					old one, with it also being the main reason why I even made<br>
					the fanart section to begin with, and I have a lot to talk<br>
					about this one despite being the oldest piece Beatum<br>
					made for me</p>

					<p style="position:relative;bottom:14px;left:6px;font-family:NokiaFC;font-size:65%;text-align:left;">
					I still think this piece is still one of the best, if not the best thing someone<br>
					ever made for me, and even though Beatum would end up drawing our characters to-<br>
					gether a lot more in the future, I'm still incredibly fond of this piece, and I<br>
					hold it so dearly to me, and it's what cemented in a way, a new chapter on my<br>
					life, because ever since I met Beatum, a lot of things started changing<br>
					a lot of them for the better, and talking to him and receiving all of the<br>
					things he has done to me through this little time I knew him always put me in<br>
					a better mood, but let's keep the personal talk to later, let's talk about the<br>
					actual art for now<br>
					<br>
					I fucking love it.<br>
					First of all, I just love the colors in this piece so much<br>
					From the way things are shaded, to the way the scenario looks, the bright<br>
					colors, the way all of the characters are there and they seem so happy next<br>
					to each other, there's a lot to take from this, and there's everything<br>
					to like about it<br>
					<br>
					This piece also always reminds me that I'm still pretty fond of Big Whiskey's<br>
					original design, his black jacket (which fun fact; is an actual jacket that<br>
					I actually own in real life, just like Big Whiskey's current jacket) contrasts<br>
					really well with his sunflower and the yellow of his shoes (even though you-<br>
					can't see his shoes in this picture), there's a minimal usage of colors, but<br>
					it really benefits his design the more I think about it, and I want to go back<br>
					and try to do something with this design once again if I ever do art again<br>
					<br>
					In general, everything Beatum does makes me want to try again<br>
					Ever since I started talking to him, it seems like my mood and life started<br>
					to take a turn for the better<br>
					<br>
					I attempted to make art again since he motivated me to try and get my tablet<br>
					to work again, I started working on my (now old) website again, around that<br>
					time I also got my first sidejob, and that would eventually lead me into<br>
					getting my first actual job, it seems that ever since I started talking to him<br>
					things just started looking up for me, this might just be a coincidence, but<br>
					being excited to talk to someone and in general just feeling happier by just<br>
					being around someone after feeling like absolute shit for so long felt so good<br>
					and the first time I saw this piece was also around a time I was hitting another<br>
					low point in life, and it instantly lit that fire inside me once again that made<br>
					me want to get up and try once again<br>
					<br>
					I might not have the best of lifes, but people like Beatum always makes me<br>
					appreciate it a little bit more than I ever could wish for<br>
					<br>
					This piece is incredible, and so is Beatum<br>
					Go give him a follow on Newgrounds, or Twitter if you're a FAGGOOOOOTTTTT<br>
					<br>
					Either way, it's nice being able to speak to you all again<br>
					I'll see you around.</p>
